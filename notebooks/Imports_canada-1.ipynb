    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze the data from the total imports of the top 25 industries in Canada. The objectives are to discover trends and patterns to predict the behavior of these industries for the current year, 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from the official website of the [Trade Data Online by the Government of Canada](https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/tdst/tdo/crtr.html?reportType=TI&grouped=GROUPED&searchType=All&timePeriod=5%7cComplete+Years&currency=CDN&naArea=9999&countryList=ALL&productType=NAICS&toFromCountry=CDN&changeCriteria=true).\n",

    "## Data Collection Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade Type:** Total imports\n",
    "- **Trader:** Canada\n",
    "- **Trading Partner:** All countries (Total)\n",
    "- **Time Period (Specific Years):** 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023\n",
    "- **Value:** $ Canadian (current dollars)\n",
    "- **Industry:** Top 25 industries (5-digit NAICS codes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries Used for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pandas:** Used for data preparation and cleaning. It allows for easy loading of data from CSV files, handling missing values, and merging multiple datasets into a single DataFrame for comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "- **NumPy:** Used for efficient data manipulation and numerical computations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, which are essential for handling the dataset and performing various mathematical operations.\n",
    "- **scikit-learn:** Used for applying machine learning algorithms to the data. Specifically, it will be used for linear regression to identify trends and make predictions about the behavior of the top 25 industries in Canada.\n",
    "- **SQLAlchemy:** Used for connecting to the SQLite database, creating tables, and inserting data from CSV files into the database.\n",
    "\n",

    "##Project Structure\n",
    "## Project Structure\n",
    "- **clean_data.py:** Python script for cleaning the data and making predictions.\n",
    "- **data/:** Directory containing the raw and cleaned data files.\n",
    "- **notebooks/:** Directory containing Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and documentation.\n",
    "- **scripts/:** Directory containing scripts for database setup and data loading.\n",
    "- **README.md:** Project documentation.\n",
    "- **requirements.txt:** List of dependencies required for the project.\n",
